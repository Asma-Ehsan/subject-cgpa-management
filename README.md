## 🧠 How It Works

1. User fills a form to add a subject (name, code, credit hours, instructor).
2. The subject appears in a dynamic list with Edit/Delete buttons.
3. User selects a grade for each subject.
4. Based on the selected grades and credit hours, CGPA is calculated in real time.
5. All data is handled in the frontend using React state only (no database or API).
